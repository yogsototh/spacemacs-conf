# Spacemacs config

This spacemacs config file try to close the gap between
my usual vim key bindings and general environment.

It focus on Haskell and Clojure development environment.

For example I use a lot the splited windows.
You can navigate between them with `C-w h`, `C-w j`, `C-w k` and `C-w l`.
I changed these key bindings by `C-h`, `C-j`, `C-k`, `C-l`.

Furthermore there is an [`elm`](http://elm-lang.org) layer.
